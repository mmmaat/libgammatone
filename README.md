processing to model the cochlea. Applications cover, among others,
voice recognition, sound localization and hearing aids design.

A lot of variations and implementations have been proposed over
years. Among these, **libgammatone aims to be a standard
implementation** suitable for research and engineering purpose.

- Clear and easy to use interface
- Fast and efficient
- Extensible and generic template design
